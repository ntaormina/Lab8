This code is an algorithim to get a two wheeled robot through a maze.

It uses a left wall follower strategy. That is if it gets too close to a left wall
it will turn right, then continue turning left. If it gets to a wall in front of it it will back up 
and turn right 90 degrees then continue turning left. 

This interfaces with Sensor library and Robot-Movement library
